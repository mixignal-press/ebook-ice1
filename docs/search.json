    "section": "2.4 Inductance",
    "text": "2.4 Inductance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Loop inductance by Faraday’s law\n\n\n\nInductors are virtually nonexistent in Integrated Circuits due to the very small loop areas. Our discussion will be confined to the self-inductance of a current loop to familiarize the reader with the fundamental concepts of self-inductance.\nFaraday’s law of induction is crucial for understanding inductance. Consider the circular wire loop in Figure 2.4 , with a small gap for introducing current \\(I\\). This current circulates counter-clockwise around the loop, as in Figure 2.4 , creating a magnetic flux density \\(B\\) through the surface \\(s\\) the loop encloses. The surface’s shape doesn’t affect the result, as long as the loop encircles it. With counter-clockwise current, the magnetic field is upward through the surface. The total magnetic flux through the loop can be calculated as\n\\[\n\\psi = \\int_S \\vec{B}\\cdot ds\n\\]\nwhere \\(s\\) is the surface enclosed by the current loop. If the current and magnetic field change over time, Faraday’s law of induction states that the change in magnetic flux through the loop induces an electromotive force (emf) around its contour.\n\\[\nemf = \\int_C \\vec{E}\\cdot dl = - d\\psi / dt\n\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is the loop’s contour around surface \\(s\\). If the loop is electrically small, we can represent the emf as a voltage source equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop:\n\\[\nV = d\\psi / dt\n\\]\nLenz’s law clarifies that the negative sign in Faraday’s law indicates the induced emf and current oppose the change in magnetic flux that creates them. Thus, the voltage source polarity is as shown in Figure 2.4 . Inductance is fundamentally the ratio of the magnetic flux through the loop to the current causing it\n\\[\nL=\\frac{\\psi}{I}\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\psi = LI\n\\]\nIn a linear, homogeneous, and isotropic medium, the magnetic flux through the loop is proportional to the current \\(I\\) that generates it, with inductance as the proportionality constant linking \\(I\\) and \\(\\psi\\). Therefore, inductance depends solely on the loop’s shape, dimensions, and the medium’s material properties. The induced voltage source is expressed as\n\\[\nV=\\frac{d\\psi}{dt}\n\\]\nor\n\\[\nV=L\\frac{dI}{dt}\n\\]\nFigure 2.4 illustrates replacing the induced source with an inductor symbol, where the voltage across it is given by \\(L\\cdot dI/dt\\) and appears as a Thevenin open-circuit voltage. If the loop’s wire has resistance, it’s shown with a resistor symbol in series, adding an IR voltage drop around the loop.\nThe technique used to determine the inductance of a loop is known as the method of flux linkages, as it involves calculating the flux that “links” with the current. This method comprises four steps:\n\nInjecting a current \\(I\\) around the closed loop.\nUse Biot-Savart’s law to find the magnetic flux density \\(\\vec{B}\\) over the loop’s surface, akin to Gauss’ law for magnetism.\nDetermine the overall magnetic flux passing through the loop by utilizing the equation \\(\\psi = \\int_S \\vec{B} \\cdot ds\\).\nDivide that flux by the current I to get the inductance of the loop.\n\nThe inductance so obtained is referred to as the self inductance of the loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Mutual inductance\n\n\n\nThe mutual inductance between two loops, one of which carries a current \\(I_1\\), is defined with reference to Figure 2.5 as\n\\[\nM_{12} = \\frac{\\psi_2}{I_1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\psi_2\\) is the flux penetrating the surface of the second loop, \\(s_2\\), that is caused by the current of the first loop:\n\\[\n\\psi_2 = \\int_{s2} \\vec{B}_{12}\\cdot ds\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods for calculating magnetic flux density\n\n\n\nThe determination of the magnetic flux density \\(\\vec{B}\\) can be performed using several approaches, all of which necessitate the computation of complex integrals. To finalize the calculation of the structure’s inductance via the flux linkage method, it will be essential to compute additional intricate integrals involving these \\(\\vec{B}\\) fields.\nThere are many textbooks that discuss various methods for their calculation, and one such source is Paul (2011) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul, Clayton R. 2011.

Time-varying voltage or current is typically denoted as \\(v(t)\\) or \\(i(t)\\).\nCONNECTION CONSTRAINTS are activated when devices are connected within a circuit. Two essential principles governed by connection constraints are Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL).\n\n3.3.1 Kirchhoff‘s Current Law (KCL)\nKirchhoff’s first law is founded on the conservation of charge principle. Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) asserts that\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirchhoff‘s Current Law (KCL)\n\n\n\nthe algebraic sum of the currents entering a node is zero at every instant.\n\n\nWhen summing currents algebraically, consider each device’s reference direction: assign a positive sign if directed into the node, and a negative sign if directed away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Circuit for demonstrating KCL\n\n\n\nApplying this convention to the nodes in Figure 3.1, we obtain the following set of KCL connection equations:\n\\[\\text{Node A: } -i_1 - i_2 = 0\\] \\[\\text{Node B: } i_1 - i_3 - i_4 + i_5= 0\\] \\[\\text{Node C: } i_2 + i_3 + i_4 - i_5= 0\\]\nThe KCL equation at node A indicates that the reference direction for currents \\(i_1\\) and \\(i_2\\) is away from node A, not that they are negative. Similarly, the equation at node B could be expressed as\n\\[\ni_1  + i_5 =  i_3 + i_4\n\\]\nThis example demonstrates a different formulation of KCL:\n\nThe sum of the currents entering a node equals the sum of the currents leaving the node.\n\nAnother general principle that can be easily derived from KCL:\n\nIn a circuit containing a total of N nodes, there are only \\(N – 1\\) independent KCL connection equations.\n\nThe current equations specified at \\(N – 1\\) nodes encapsulate all the independent connection constraints derivable from the Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquivalent circuits\n\n\n\nNote that the three parallel elements in Figure 3.1 can be replaced by one equivalent element, which can generally be stated as:\n\nTwo circuits are said to be equivalent if they have identical \\(i–v\\) characteristics at a specified pair of terminals.\n\nFor example, if the 3 elements were resistors \\(R_1, R_2, R_3\\), they can be replaced with an equivalent resistor of value \\(R_1R_2R_3/(R_1+R_2+R_3)\\).\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)\nKirchhoff’s second circuit law is rooted in the energy conservation principle. According to the Kirchhoff voltage law (KVL),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirchoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)\n\n\n\nthe algebraic sum of all voltages around a loop is zero at every instant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Circuit for demonstrating KVL\n\n\n\nThree loops in Figure 3.2 show the circuit. A voltage receives a positive sign when moving from “+” to “–” and a negative sign from “–” to “+.” The loop’s clockwise traversal gives these KVL equations.\n\\[ \\text{Loop 1: } -v_1 + v_2 + v_3 = 0 \\] \\[ \\text{Loop 2: } -v_3 + v_4 + v_5 = 0 \\] \\[ \\text{Loop 3: } -v_1 + v_2 + v_4 + v_5 = 0 \\]\nTwo signs are linked to each voltage. The first sign is used when formulating the KVL connection equation. The second sign depends on the real polarity of the voltage compared to its designated reference polarity.\nA general principle can be derived from KVL :\n\nFor a circuit that includes \\(E\\) number of two-terminal elements and has \\(N\\) nodes, only \\(E - N + 1\\) independent Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) equations can be formed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on assigning voltage polarities and current direction\n\n\n\nWhen voltage polarities or current directions are missing in a circuit diagram, they need to be set arbitrarily before analysis. These assignments don’t reflect the actual circuit conditions. If the assumed direction and polarities match the actual ones, the response’s sign will be positive; otherwise, it will be negative.\n\nIn other words, the sign of the answer together with the assigned polarities and directions tells us the actual voltage polarity or current direction. \n\nIn the passive sign convention, we can choose either the + voltage reference or the current reference arrow for a two-terminal element, but not both simultaneously. Once the voltage reference is set, the current arrow must enter the terminal with the + mark. Conversely, if the current reference is chosen first, the + voltage reference is applied to the same terminal.",

    "text": "3.4 Circuit Analysis Techniques\nWe can apply Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws to develop two key circuit analysis techniques: nodal analysis, using Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and mesh analysis, using Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL). These techniques are crucial to any circuit analysis. By developing these methods, we can analyze almost any circuit by forming and solving simultaneous equations to find currents or voltages. One solution for these equations is Cramer’s rule, which calculates circuit variables using determinant quotients.\n\n3.4.1 Nodal Analysis\nNodal analysis, or node-voltage analysis, analyzes circuits by using node voltages as variables, simplifying the process and reducing the number of simultaneous equations. It focuses on determining node voltages and follows three steps for a circuit with n nodes without voltage sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps to determine node voltage\n\n\n\n\nSelect a reference node. Assign a voltage \\(v_1, v_2, \\ldots , v_{n-1}\\) to the remaining \\(N– 1\\) nodes.\nApply KCL to each of the \\(N-1\\) non-reference nodes. Use Ohm’s law to express the branch currents in terms of node voltages.\nSolve the resulting simultaneous equations to obtain the unknown node voltages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Circuit for demonstrating node-voltage analysis\n\n\n\nThe circuit in Figure 3.3 illustrates node-voltage equation formulation, identifying a reference node (ground), four currents (\\(i_0\\), \\(i_1\\), \\(i_2\\), \\(i_3\\)), and two node voltages (\\(v_A\\), \\(v_A\\)).\nAt the two nodes that are not used as references, the KCL constraints can be stated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Node A: } -i_0-i_1-i_2 = 0\\] \\[ \\text{Node B: } i_2-i_3 = 0\\]\nBy applying the core principles of node analysis, we can connect element currents with node voltages through the corresponding element equations.\n\\[\\text{Resistor} R_1\\text{: } i_1 = \\frac{v_A}{R_1} \\] \\[\\text{Resistor} R_2\\text{: } i_2 = \\frac{v_A-v_B}{R_2} \\] \\[\\text{Resistor} R_3\\text{: } i_3 = \\frac{v_B}{R_3} \\] \\[\\text{Current source: } i_0 = -i_S \\]\nWe formulate six equations for six unknowns, four currents of the element, and two node voltages. The right side of these equations involves unknown node voltages and the input signal \\(i_S\\). By substituting device constraints into the KCL equation and rearranging terms, we derive the following standard form:\n\\[ \\text{Node A: } \\left({\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R_2}}\\right) v_A - \\frac{v_B}{R_2} = i_S\\] \\[ \\text{Node B: } \\frac{v_A}{R_2} + \\left({\\frac{1}{R_2}+\\frac{1}{R_3}}\\right) v_B = 0\\]\nIn this standard form, unknown node voltages are on one side, and independent sources on the other, easing analysis. By eliminating element currents, the circuit is reduced to two linear equations with two unknown node voltages.\nThe node-voltage method simplifies solving to \\(N– 1\\) equations. With \\(E\\) elements, the reduction from \\(2E\\) to \\(N– 1\\) is notable in circuits having many elements (\\(E\\)) interconnected in parallel (\\(N\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNodal Analysis with voltage sources\n\n\n\nTwo methods to handle voltage sources in nodal analysis: 1) Set one node as the reference node, 2) Form a supernode with both nodes to apply KCL, ensuring the voltage across it equals the source voltage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving linear algebraic equations\n\n\n\nThe linear equation system derived from node analysis is solvable using either manual calculations or computer-aided approaches. An integrated circuit (IC) engineer should be proficient in both methods. For lower complexity problems with numerical coefficients, techniques such as Cramer’s Rule or Gaussian Elimination can be applied (Thomas, Rosa, and Toussaint 2016), (Alexander and Sadiku 2007).\nAs the complexity of the problem rises, employing a programming language such as Python or a circuit simulator like ngspice becomes more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Mesh Analysis\nMesh analysis, the dual of node analysis, is a method for analyzing circuits using mesh currents as variables, simplifying equations by using these currents instead of element currents. A loop is a closed path passing each node once, while a mesh is a loop without any smaller loops inside. Nodal analysis uses KCL to find unknown voltages, while mesh analysis uses KVL to find unknown currents. Mesh analysis is less general than nodal analysis as it only applies to planar circuits, which can be drawn without crossing branches. Circuits with crossing branches may still be planar if they can be redrawn without them.\nA circuit with \\(n\\) meshes can be analyzed using three steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps to determine mesh current\n\n\n\n\nAssign mesh currents \\(i_1, i_2, \\ldots i_n\\) to the \\(n\\) meshes.\nApply KVL to each of the \\(n\\) meshes using Ohm’s law to express voltages in terms of the mesh currents.\nSolve the resulting \\(n\\) simultaneous equations to get the mesh currents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: A circuit with two meshes\n\n\n\nRefer to Figure 3.4, where mesh currents \\(i_1\\) and \\(i_2\\) are assigned clockwise by convention, though any direction is possible. Applying KVL to each mesh, we obtain\n\\[ (R_1+R_3)i_1 - R_3i_2 = V_1\\] \\[ -R_3i_1 + (R2+R_3)i_2 = -V_2\\]\nNow we can solve the simultaneous equations using the techniques of our choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMesh Analysis with current sources\n\n\n\nSimilar to nodal analysis with voltage sources, two methods to handle current sources in mesh analysis: 1) When a current source exists only in one mesh, the mesh current is simply set to the current value of the current source, 2) When a current source exists between two meshes, create a supermesh such that KVL can be applied to it.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Superposition Principle\nThe linearity principle states that the output of a linear circuit with multiple inputs is a linear combination of scaled inputs:\n\\[ y = \\sum^n_{i=1} f(K_i x_i) = \\sum^n_{i=1} K_i f(x_i) = \\sum^n_{i=1} y_i\\]\nwhere \\(x_i\\) are the inputs of current or voltage and \\(K_i\\) are the scalar constants that are circuit-dependent.\nThe output is a linear combination where each input’s contribution is independent. Thus, the total output is the sum of each source’s individual response, allowing us to determine the output of a multiple input linear circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree-step approach to solving linear circuits using superposition principle\n\n\n\n\n“Turn Off” all independent sources save for one, then determine the circuit’s output as a result of the influence of that single source.\nContinue the procedure in step 1 for each independent source, ensuring all other sources are turned off, and determine the output resulting from that specific source.\nThe combined output from all independent sources activated simultaneously is the algebraic sum of the outputs produced by each source independently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning Off Independent Sources\n\n\n\nSwitching off an independent source implies setting its value to zero, denoted as \\(v_s=0\\) or \\(i_s=0\\). In this case, a voltage source is substituted by a short circuit, and a current source by an open circuit. Does this substitution alter the circuit? The answer is no. As zero is a legitimate value for each independent source, the resulting circuit remains valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: (a) Circuit used to demonstrate superposition. (b) Block diagram.\n\n\n\nWe demonstrate the superposition principle by examining the two-input circuit in Figure 3.5 (a) through node-voltage analysis. By employing KCL at node A and rearranging the terms, we obtain the equation\n\\[ v_o = \\left[{\\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}}\\right]v_S + \\left[{\\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}}\\right]i_S\\]\nThe outcome indicates that the result is a linear combination of the two inputs. A typical block diagram is depicted in Figure 3.5 (b).\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Thevenin and Norton Equivalent Circuits\nThe Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuit theorems stand as foundational elements in circuit theory, often taken for granted. These theorems simplify circuit analysis significantly, and without them, circuit analysis would be difficult.\nTHE THEOREMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: A linear circuit with resistors and both dependent and independent sources is connected to a linear or non-linear load.\n\n\n\nConsider a circuit with linear elements, such as resistors, dependent, and independent voltage and current sources as shown in Figure 3.6. Capacitors and inductors are excluded for simplicity, but the theorem applies to them as well. We focus on linear time-invariant circuits, although the theorems are valid for time-varying circuits as well Thomas, Rosa, and Toussaint (2016). This circuit is connected to a linear or non-linear load circuit.\nThevenin’s theorem simply states that the entire circuit can be replaced with an independent voltage source and a series resistor, which is indistinguishable from its original circuit in terms of their i-v characteristics.\nSimilarly, Norton’s theorem states that the entire circuit can be replaced with a single independent current source in parallel with a resistor which, again, is indistinguishable from its original circuit in terms of their i-v characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Thevenin Equivalent: (a) Disconnect the load and measure the open-circuit voltage. (b) Zero all independent sources to find the equivalent resistance. (c) The Thévenin circuit combines the open-circuit voltage in series with the equivalent resistance.\n\n\n\nTo determine the Thévenin voltage source, open the load connection and measure the open-circuit voltage \\(v_{oc} (t)\\) at the output port as in Figure 3.7 (a). For Thévenin resistance, disconnect the load, set all independent sources to zero, and find the equivalent resistance of the remaining circuit, which consists of resistors and dependent sources, and reduce it to a single resistor. The Thévenin equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 3.7 (c).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Norton Equivalent: (a) Short the load and measure the current to find the short circuit current. (b) Zero all independent sources in the block to find the equivalent resistance. (c) The Norton equivalent circuit consists of the short circuit current in parallel with the equivalent resistance from (a) and (b).\n\n\n\nTo determine the Norton current source, short the output port as in Figure 3.8 (a) and measure the short circuit current \\(i_{sc} (t)\\). The Norton resistance, parallel to this current source, is found exactly like the Thévenin resistance, as shown in Figure 3.8 (b). The Norton equivalent circuit is depicted in Figure 3.8 (c).\nTo find the equivalent resistance, zero all independent sources: short voltage sources and open current sources. But if the circuits are inaccessible, like in a black box, can we still find it? Yes, the equivalent resistance equals \\(v_{oc} (t)/i_{sc} (t)\\). We can easily calculate it by measuring \\(v_{oc} (t)\\) and \\(i_{sc} (t)\\) without seeing inside.\nThe big question is why these theorems are valid. How do you prove them? See Sheikholeslami (2018) for an intuitive proof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nLet us find the Thevenin and Norton’s equivalent of the circuit shown in Figure 3.5.\nThe open-circuit Thevenin voltage has already been calculated in the example to be\n\\[ v_{oc} = \\left[{\\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}}\\right]v_S + \\left[{\\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}}\\right]i_S\\],\nand the Thevenin, Norton as well, resistance can be calculated by shorting independent voltage source and opening independent current sources, resulting in\n\\[ R_{eq} = R_1 || R_2 = \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}\\]\nThe Norton short-circuit current can be shown to be\n\\[i_{sc} = \\frac{v_S}{R_1} + i_S\\]\n\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Max Power Transfer and Interfacing Circuits\nIn circuits where efficiency of power delivery is crucial, interfacing circuits have to be properly designed to ensure maximum power is delivered to the load. For example, an audio amplifier that delivers power to a speaker is typically between \\(4-8 \\Omega\\). Or a power amplifier on a mobile phone that delivers power to the antenna which is typically \\(50 \\Omega\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: (a) Circuit used for max power transfer analysis. (b) Sketch of power delivered to the load as a function of \\(R_L\\)\n\n\n\nWe now address the problem of delivering maximum power to a load by a circuit. This is best done by representing the circuit with it’s Thevenin (or Norton) equivalent circuit connected to the load as shown in Figure 3.9 (a) .\nThe Thevenin equivalent is useful for finding the maximum power a linear circuit can deliver to a load. We assume that we can adjust the load resistance \\(R_L\\). The power delivered to the load is\n\\[p = i^2R_L = \\left({\\frac{V_{Th}}{R_{Th}+R_L}}\\right)^2 R_L\\]\nIn a circuit with fixed \\(V_{Th}\\) and \\(R_{Th}\\), altering the load resistance \\(R_L\\) changes the power delivered to the load as illustrated in Figure 3.9 (b). The sketch shows that power is minimal when \\(R_L\\) is too small or too large, but peaks at some \\(R_L\\) value between \\(0\\) and \\(\\infty\\). It can be shown that maximum power is achieved when \\(R_L\\) equals \\(R_{Th}\\), known as the maximum power theorem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum power theorem\n\n\n\nMaximum power is transferred to the load when the load resistance equals the Thevenin resistance as seen from the load (\\(R_L = R_{Th}\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise\n\n\n\nProve the maximum power theorem by taking the derivative of power w.r.t. the load \\(R_L\\) and set it to zero. (\\(dp/dR_L = 0\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuitive proof\n\n\n\nPower from \\(V_{Th}\\) varies with \\(R_L\\) as \\(V^2_{Th}/(R_{Th}+R_L)\\), ranging from \\(0\\) to \\(V^2_{Th}/R_{Th}\\) when \\(R_L\\) shifts from \\(\\infty\\) to \\(0\\). Most of this power is transferred to the load when \\(R_L &gt; R_{TH}\\); however, if \\(R_L &lt; R_{TH}\\), more power is lost in \\(R_{TH}\\). Therefore, maximum transfer occurs when \\(R_L = R_{Th}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming exercise\n\n\n\nWrite to program which plots \\(i \\text{ vs } R_L\\), \\(p_L \\text{ vs } R_L\\), and \\(p_s \\text{ vs } R_L\\) where, \\(i\\) is the current drawn from the source, \\(p_L\\) is the power delivered to the load, and \\(p_s\\) is the power consumed from the source.\n\n\nINTERFACING CIRCUITS\nIn typical applications such as an audio amplifier driving a speaker \\(4~\\Omega\\) or a power amplifier in a mobile phone driving a \\(50~\\Omega\\) antenna, the load is fixed and the circuit designer designs the circuit so that the source impedance \\(R_{Th}\\) is equal to the load \\(R_L\\).\nThere are times when the circuit designer does not have the freedom to change \\(R_{TH}\\) (or \\(R_L\\)), then an interfacing circuit is necessary to facilitate maximum power transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: A general interface circuit and a few examples: (a) Simple pass-through (often omitted), (b) series resistor, (c) parallel resistor, (d) L-pad left, (e) L-pad right\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10 illustrates general and example resistive interface circuits. These circuits feature two terminal pairs, or ports, forming a two-port network, with an input connected to the source and an output to the load. The network ensures specific source-load interaction. There are countless interface circuit designs, but Figure 3.10 highlights five basic ones. Pass-through is simply a direct connection when design allows source or load variation. Series interfaces suit voltage-powered loads, while parallel interfaces are for current-powered loads. L-pads match fixed source and load resistances to achieve desired electrical outputs.\n\n\n\n\nAlexander, Charles K., and Matthew N. O. Sadiku. 2007. Fundamentals of Electric Circuits.

    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nThe large-scale integration of electronic circuits is rooted in the invention and evolution of semiconductor devices. We will discuss electronic materials to explain the fundamental properties of semiconductors in IC design and their role in the success of integrated circuits.\nThe fundamental materials in integrated circuits include metals, dielectrics, and semiconductors. Metals are used as conductors for interconnects because of their extremely low specific resistivity. Specific resistivity (\\(\\rho\\)) is a property of the material that can be defined as resistance per unit volume expressed in SI units of \\(\\Omega m\\) but more conveniently as \\(\\Omega cm\\). The resistance of a rectangular piece of that material can be expressed as \\(R=\\rho\\cdot l/A\\), where \\(l\\) is the length and \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area. In integrated circuit design, the height of the metal routing is fixed and is typically in the range of \\(0.1\\) to \\(5\\) micrometers (\\(\\mu m, 10^{-6} m)\\) and the resistance is measured in unit squares as or \\(\\Omega/\\square\\). The specific resistance (in \\(\\Omega cm\\)) and unit resistance (in \\(\\Omega/\\square\\)) of typical metals used in integrated circuits such as aluminum (Al), copper (Cu) and gold (Au) are tabulated in Table 5.1. Dielectric materials have extremely large specific resistances that provide electrical insulation for typical operating conditions. Specific resistances for semiconductors can vary enormously \\(-\\) from \\(10^{-4} ~\\Omega cm\\) to \\(10^{12} ~\\Omega cm\\).\nThe history of semiconductors began with Tomas Seebeck’s observation of lead sulfur (PbS) properties in 1821. Michael Faraday noted that semiconductor resistance decreases with rising temperatures, unlike conductors. Early applications include Werner von Siemens’ selenium photometer (1875) and Alexander Graham Bell’s wireless device (1878). The pivotal discovery of the Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) by Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain in 1947 led to today’s integrated circuits with millions of devices in a single IC.\nElectronic systems operate using a power supply formed by non-electric forces that separate charges to create a potential difference. Chemical forces generate batteries, while turbines produce AC, which is converted to DC voltages. This potential difference forms an electric field, driving current in the circuit. Manipulating this current with semiconductor devices in an integrated circuit is essential for intelligent systems like modern computers..\nSemiconductor devices excel in integrated circuits due to their rapid conductivity changes, small size, and low energy use. They are manufactured at nanometer scales with switching speeds of 100 gigahertz, consuming nanowatts of power. Their conductivity can shift dramatically from insulator to conductor, representing digital zeros and ones. Understanding semiconductors like silicon involves studying the physics of their conductivity changes, which vary significantly with temperature as well.\nSome excellent references for this subject matter are (Shur 1996), (Pierret 1996), (Streetman and Banerjee 2014), and (Gray and Searle 1969)",

    "section": "5.2 Energy Band Model",
    "text": "5.2 Energy Band Model\nThe energy band model explains the conduction properties of matter easily that we will introduce now using quantum mechanical properties of matter. Instead of explaining the model for a semiconductor crystal such as silicon, the basic principles can be explained using a much simpler atomic system, the isolated hydrogen atom. During the 1900s, the emission spectrum of heated gases did not agree with the contemporary physical model of continuous electron energy. In order to reconcile the discrepancy, in 1913 Neils Bohr proposed that the electrons can have only certain discrete allowed energy levels, called energy states.\nFor hydrogen atom the quantization of energy states is \\(E_n = -E_B/n^2\\) where \\(n = 1,2,3,4,\\ldots\\) is called the energy quantum number and \\(E_B\\) is called the Bohr energy or the electron binding energy.\nFor hydrogen atom, Bohr energy \\(E_B = 13.6 eV/n^2\\)\nElectron energies are expressed in electron volt (eV), the work done to move an electron across a potential difference of \\(1~V\\).\n[\\(1~eV = q\\times 1V = 1.602\\times 10^{-19} Joule\\)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Conceptual development of the energy band model starting with N isolated Si atoms on the top left, then showing the split bands for Crytalline SI N-atoms and concluding, at bottom right, with the popular version of the energy band model.\n\n\n\nLet us now study the many electron energies of a Si crystal (Si), which is more complicated, but the basic principles still apply. The concept of band diagrams can be qualitatively conceived by starting with N-isolated Si atoms and observing the energy states as the atoms are brought closer and closer together (see Figure 5.1). Pauli exclusion principle plays an important role in determining energy states as the atoms are brought closer. The principle states that no more than two electrons can occupy each energy state. In a solid material, as many atoms (N) are brought closer, the energy states start to split to satisfy the exclusion principle. At the interatomic spacing of the lattice, the split energy levels form essentially continuous energy bands. However, these bands are separated by forbidden energy gaps that cannot be occupied by any electron. The magnitude of the forbidden energy gaps determines primarily the electrical properties of different materials. In filling the allowed energy states, electrons tend to gravitate to the lowest possible states. At room temperature in semiconductors and dielectrics, almost all of the states in the lower energy bands are filled by electrons, and the higher energy states are mostly empty. The upper band of the allowed states is called the conduction band; the lower band of the allowed states is called the valence band; and the gap between the two bands without any allowed energy states, the forbidden band or the energy band gap. An electron in the valence band needs energy equal to or greater than the energy band gap to transition from the valence band to the conduction band.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Illustration of the distinction between (a) insulator, (b) semiconductor, and (c) metal.\n\n\n\nTypically, for semiconductors, the energy band gap, \\(E_g\\), varies between \\(0.1~eV\\) and \\(3.5~eV\\).\nAt room temperature (T=300K), \\(E_G=1.42eV\\) (GaAs), \\(E_G=1.12eV\\) (Si), and \\(E_G=0.66eV\\) (Ge).\nIn dielectric, the energy band gap is large and so the valence bands are completely filled and the conduction band is totally void of electrons making them perfect insulators. Typically for dielectrics, \\(E_g\\) is larger than \\(5~eV\\) (diamond) to \\(8~eV~(SiO_2)\\). In a metal, the lowest conduction band is partially filled with many electrons, making it an ideal conductor.",

    "section": "5.3 Carriers",
    "text": "5.3 Carriers\nCarriers are the current-carrying entities within the semiconductor material and we are now in a position to introduce them, the semiconductor model having been well established. Referring to our bonding model, there are no carriers or possible current flow if no bonds are broken in the semiconductor solid. In the energy band model, this refers to a valence band which is completely filled with electrons and a conduction band which is completely devoid of electrons. This will be the case for a pure semiconductor like a silicon crystal at temperature \\(T=0^\\circ K\\). Now, for an electron to carry current under the influence of an applied electric field, it has to break free from the bond, for example, the Si-Si bond. In terms of the energy band model, this refers to an electron from the valence band jumping over to the conduction band creating carriers; that is, electrons in the conduction band are carriers. Note that the energy required to break a bond is the same as the forbidden energy gap \\(E_G\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Visualization of carriers using the bonding model (left) and the energy band model (right) (a) No-carrier situation; (b) visualization of an electron; (c ) visualization of a hole\n\n\n\nThe average thermal energy of an electron, in equilibrium, is equal to \\(3k_BT/2\\) where, \\(k_B\\) is the Boltzmann constant and \\(T\\) is the temperature in degrees Kelvin. The generally accepted room temperature is \\(27^\\circ C\\) or \\(300~K\\).\n\\(k_BT = 1.38\\times 10^{-23} \\frac{J}{K} \\times 300~K = 0.026~eV\\)\nThis energy is attributed to the electron’s thermal motion inside the crystal lattice that can be explained accurately using quantum mechanics. But an effective mass formulation is a simplified classical way of explaining the same phenomenon. This allows us to formulate the carriers as quasi-classical particles and employ classical particle relationships in most device analyzes. Using this formulation, the average thermal energy can be attributed to the average kinetic energy \\(m^*_n v_{th}^2/2\\) where \\(m^*_n\\) is the effective electron mass and \\(v_{th}\\) is called the electron thermal velocity.\nThe electron effective mass \\(m^*_n\\) is different from the free electron mass \\(m^*_e\\) which is \\(9.11\\times 10^{-31}kg\\). For example, in silicon, \\(m^*_n\\approx 0.066~m_e\\).\nHowever, \\(3k_BT/2\\) is just the average energy, and the actual energies of an individual electron vary widely. A few electrons acquire enough thermal energy to jump into the conduction band.\nEnergy gap \\(E_G\\) of silicon (Si) is \\(\\approx 1.12 ~eV\\) which is approximately 45 times larger than \\(k_BT\\) at room temperature!\nSince there can be no current in the absence of an electric field, the random motions of the electrons compensate for each other. In the presence of an electric field, in addition to random motions, the electrons seem to drift in the direction of the electric with a so-called drift velocity which results in an electric current.\nNow let us look at a phenomenon, unique to semiconductors, when an electron breaks free from a bond. It leaves a vacancy for another electron to break free from its bond and occupy this vacancy which in turn leaves another vacancy and so on leading to an appearance of a motion of a vacant electron of a positive charge \\(q=-(-q)\\) and an effective mass of \\(m^*_p\\). This motion is typically represented as a fictitious particle called a hole. This phenomenon can be imagined as analogous to the bubble in a fluid. In terms of the energy band model, jumping an electron to the conduction band creates a hole in an otherwise vast sea of filled states. This empty state, like a bubble in a fluid, moves about rather freely in the solid because of the cooperative motion of valence-band electrons that give room to this hole in motion. Like a free electron carrier, when an electric field is applied to this semiconductor, the hole, an apparent positive electron, will move in the direction of the electric field, giving rise to electric current.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Electrons move in an electric field. The band diagrams are like Figure 5.2, but with an expanded energy scale showing closely packed levels, each accommodating two electrons.

    "text": "5.4 Band Diagrams\nBand diagrams are a very efficient way of illustrating electrical properties of semiconductor materials and devices without going into the detail atomic or molecular structure of the material. As shown in Figure 5.4, the band diagram represents the electrical energies allowed within the semiconductor as a function of position, where the increase in energy \\(E\\) upward represents the total energy of electrons. The charge carriers or free charge carriers start to occupy the lowest energy states in the conduction band which are lower edge of the conduction band (\\(E_C\\)) and upper edge of the valence band (\\(E_V\\)) for electrons and holes, respectively.\nTherefore, to analyze or understand the electrical behavior of a uniform semiconductor material it is typically sufficient to study the material properties with the band edges only. Normal operation is assumed here without any external disturbances, where the electric field, magnetic field, temperature gradient, and stress-induced effects are negligible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Relationship between band bending and electrostatic variables in a semiconductor: (a) energy band diagram showing band bending; (b) identification of carrier kinetic energies; (c) electron potential energy; (d) electrostatic potential; (e) electric field vs. position from part (a).\n\n\n\nOn careful examination of the band diagram, we can show that an energy equal to the bandgap, \\(E_G = E_C-E_V\\), is required to break an atomic bond to create motionless electrons and holes occupying \\(E_C\\) and \\(E_V\\), respectively. Therefore, we can interpret the edges of the band \\(E_C\\) and \\(E_V\\) as the potential energy of the electron and hole, respectively, with reference to an arbitrary energy level \\(E_{ref}\\).\nPotential Energy: \\(P.E.=E_C-E_{ref}\\) NOTE: Show PE and KE on the diagram itself.\nAny energy in excess of \\(E_G\\) will result in the kinetic energy shown in figure Figure 5.5, with the carriers moving rapidly in the lattice. The potential energy is the key to relating the positional variations in the energy band with the electric field within the semiconductor. The potential energy (\\(P.E.\\)) of an electron (\\(-q\\)) can be expressed as \\(-qV\\), where \\(V\\) is the electrostatic potential at a given point with reference to an arbitrary constant.

The bands are tilted with a slope of \\(-qE\\) popularly known as band bending. Since electrons are negatively charged, the direction of the forces on electrons is opposite to that of the electric field. The forces on the holes are in the same direction as the electric field. Consequently, the electrons and holes move in opposite directions.\n\\[\nE=-\\nabla V \\text{ or,}\n\\]\n\\[\nE_x = -dV/dx\n\\]\n\\[\nE_x = \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{dE_C}{dx} \\text{ or,}\n\\]\n\\[\nE_x = \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{dE_V}{dx}  \\text{ or,}\n\\]\n\\[\nE_x = \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{dE_i}{dx}\n\\]\nUsing basic electrostatic laws, the relationship between the potential \\(V\\) and electric field \\(\\vec{E}\\) can be established. For quick analysis by inspection, the \\(V\\) and \\(x\\) relationship can be found simply by “inverting” \\(E_C\\) (or \\(E_V\\)) and to determine the \\(\\vec{E}\\) versus \\(x\\) relationship, simply note the slope of \\(E_C\\) (or \\(E_V\\)).\nA pure semiconductor that contains an insignificant amount of impurity atoms is commonly referred to as an intra-intrinsic semiconductor. In other words, it is a semiconductor whose properties are native to the material without any external additives. In an intrinsic semiconductor, the electron concentration in the conduction band and the holes in the valence band are negligible compared to the number of available energy states within \\(k_B T\\) from the edges of the band.\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Intrinsic electron-hole concentration of different semiconductor material at room temperature\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial\n\\(n_i\\)\n\n\n\n\nSi\n\\(1\\times 10^{10}/cm^3\\)\n\n\nGe\n\\(2\\times 10^{13}/cm^3\\)\n\n\nGaAs\n\\(2\\times 10^{6}/cm^3\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, the number of electrons and holes per cubic-centimeter are defined as \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) respectively.

    "text": "5.5 Doping\nDoping is a semiconductor engineering method to change the electron or hole concentration of the native material by many orders of magnitude. As a result, the conductance of the semiconductor varies by a large magnitude. Doping is a routine method in IC fabrication in which semiconductor impurity atoms called dopants are added to the pure semiconductor material. Dopants that increase the electron concentration of the native semiconductor material are called donors. Consequently, acceptors are dopants that increase hole concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Visualization of (a) donor and (b) acceptor actions via the bonding model. In (a), Column V element P replaces a Si atom; in (b), Column III element B replaces a Si atom.\n\n\n\nCommonly used silicon dopants are listed in Table 5.3. Phosphorous dopants, closely followed by arsenic, are the most commonly used donor dopants to increase the electron concentration. Boron is the most commonly used acceptor dopant for increasing hole concentration.\nThe donors are all from the Column-V of the Periodic Table of Elements and correspondingly, the acceptors are from Column-III.\nAs shown in Figure 5.7, using the bonding model, when a Column-V element replaces a silicon atom, four valence electrons bond with nearby silicon atoms, while the fifth is weakly bound to the donor site. At room temperature, this electron gains enough energy to become a conduction band carrier without increasing hole concentration, leaving an immobile ion.\nThe binding energy of a Phosphorous donor electron in silicon is about \\(0.045~eV\\) compared to \\(1~eV\\) for Si-Si atom.\nA semiconductor doped with donors is called an n-type semiconductor.\n\\(n+\\) and \\(n-\\) refers to heavily and lightly doped n-type semiconductor.\nAt room temperature or above, each donor atom in an n-type semiconductor contributes one electron to the conduction band, making the electron concentration in the conduction band approximately equal to the donor concentration, typically expressed in \\(atoms/cm^3\\).\nA Column-III acceptor element replaces a silicon atom, accepting an electron from a neighboring Si-Si bond to complete its bonding. This creates a hole that can move through the lattice, depicted as a hole weakly bound to the acceptor site.\nThe binding energy of a Boron acceptor hole in silicon is about \\(0.045~eV\\).\nA semiconductor doped with an acceptor is called an p-type semiconductor. At room temperature or hotter temperatures, each acceptor atom in an p-type semiconductor supplies one hole to the valence band and therefore the hole concentration, \\(p\\), in the valence band is approximately equal to the acceptor concentration, \\(N_A\\), typically expressed in \\(atoms/cm^3\\).\n\\(p+\\) and \\(p-\\) refer to heavily and lightly doped n-type semiconductor, respectively.\nAn important relation used in the analysis of semiconductor devices is the constant product of hole and electron concentration, \\(p\\) and \\(n\\), for a given temperature, which can be conveniently written as\n\\[\n    np = n_i^2\n\\]\nwhere, \\(n_i\\) is the electron or hole concentration in an intrinsic semiconductor material at that temperature.\nIntegrated circuits for commercial, industrial, or military use must perform across a wide temperature range, \\(-40^\\circ~C\\) to \\(125^\\circ~C\\). Understanding carrier concentration’s temperature dependence is crucial for semiconductors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: (a) Typical temperature dependence of majority-carrier concentration in a phosphorus-doped semiconductor. The plot includes \\(n_i/N_D\\) vs. T (dashed line) for comparison. (b) Qualitative explanation of the concentration-temperature relationship shown in (a).\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8 illustrates a carrier concentration vs. temperature plot for Si doped with phosphorus \\(N_D = 10^{15}/cm^3\\), highlighting the dependence of carrier concentration on temperature.

Below the extrinsic range, donor electrons lack energy to enter the conduction band. Around temperature \\(150~K\\), most donor electrons are in the conduction band. As temperature rises, electrons from Si-Si bonds are excited but remain below \\(N_D\\). Beyond the extrinsic range, Si-Si bond electrons surpass donor electrons, equating carrier concentration to an intrinsic semiconductor in the intrinsic range.",

When a weak electric field is applied across a semiconductor material, a so-called drift velocity is superimposed on top of the chaotic thermal motion of electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: Expanded view of a biased \\(p\\)-type semiconductor bar of cross-sectional area \\(A\\).\n\n\n\nThe drift velocities, \\(v_n\\) and \\(v_p\\), of the electrons and holes are proportional to the electric field, \\(\\vec{E}\\)\n\\[\nv_n = -\\mu_n\\vec{E}\n\\]\n\\[\nv_p = \\mu_p\\vec{E}\n\\]\nwhere, \\(\\mu_n\\) and \\(\\mu_p\\) are called the electron mobility and the hole mobility, respectively.

For the p-type semiconductor bar with a unit cross-sectional area depicted in Figure 5.11, the hole current density, \\(J_P\\), can be straightforwardly defined as:\n\\[\n    J_P = qp v_p\n\\]\nIn order to relate the current to the applied electric field, one can substitute the hole drift velocity \\(v_p\\) with the formula \\(\\mu_p\\vec{E}\\).\n\\[\n    J_P = qp\\mu_p\\vec{E}\n\\]\nIn a similar way, the current density for electrons can be represented as\n\\[\nJ_N = qn\\mu_n\\vec{E}\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\nObserve that the electrons move in the opposite direction to the applied electric field (\\(v_n = -\\mu_n\\vec{E}\\)). However, the current density flows in the opposite direction of this drift velocity due to the negative charge of the electrons (\\(J_N = -qn v_n\\)). Consequently, as stated in Equation 5.1, the resulting electron current aligns with the direction of the applied electric field.\nIn semiconductors where both electrons and holes function as charge carriers, the overall current density is represented by\n\\[\n    J = q\\vec{E}\\left({n\\mu_n + p\\mu_p}\\right)\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\nIn n-type materials, the contribution from hole-current can often be overlooked since the hole concentration, \\(p\\), is significantly smaller in comparison to the electron concentration, \\(n\\). Similarly, in p-type semiconductors, the electron current can be disregarded.\nEquation 5.2 is commonly referred to as Ohm’s Law and can be expressed in its well-known format.\n\\[\n  I = \\frac{V}{R}\n\\tag{5.3}\\]\nwhere \\(I=J \\cdot A\\) represents the overall current passing through a cross-sectional area \\(A\\) of the sample.

In equilibrium, holes migrate from the \\(p\\) region to the \\(n\\) region, moving from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. This movement leaves behind a zone of immobile, negatively charged acceptor ions near the junction. Similarly, electrons move from the \\(n\\) region to the \\(p\\) region, resulting in an accumulation of positively charged donor ions near the junction (see Figure 5.13). The interface thus forms a space charge region or depletion region, characterized by the absence of holes in the \\(p\\)-region and electrons in the \\(n\\)-region. These immobile charges on either side generate a potential barrier known as the contact potential \\(V_0\\), also referred to as a built-in potential, which ultimately inhibits further crossing of electrons and holes across the interface.\nIn the n-region, the majority of electrons reside in energy states near the conduction band edge \\(E_C\\), having minimal thermal energy. As energy levels rise from the band edge, the quantity of electrons diminishes exponentially, leaving only a small number able to surpass the built-in potential barrier. Upon crossing, the built-in electric field moves them to the p-side. Likewise, on the p-side, a similar process occurs with holes, maintaining a net current of zero.\nUnder equilibrium conditions, the overall current resulting from both drift and diffusion processes, such as for holes, sums to zero.\n\\[\n\\frac{J_{P_x}}{q} = \\mu_{p_x}  E_x - D_p \\frac{d p_x}{dx} = 0\n\\tag{5.8}\\]\nBy applying this condition, the relationship between the contact potential and the doping concentrations on each side of the junction can be determined as:\n\\[\nV_0 = \\frac{kT}{q}\\ln{\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}}\n\\tag{5.9}\\]\nassuming the doping concentration dominates on both sides. Then, applying the equilibrium condition \\(p_pn_p = n_i^2 = n_nn_p\\), the #eq-semi-dev-contact-v can be reformulated into a more advantageous form as:\n\\[\n\\frac{p_p}{p_n} = \\frac{n_n}{n_p} = e^{qV_0/kT}\n\\tag{5.10}\\]\nwhere \\(p_p\\) and \\(p_n\\) signify the hole densities on the \\(p\\) and \\(n\\) regions, respectively, while \\(n_n\\) and \\(n_p\\) indicate the electron densities on the \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) regions, respectively.\nEvaluate the situation of forward bias, where a voltage \\(V_F\\) is applied across the p-side relative to the n-side. This causes a linear reduction in the potential barrier by \\(V_F\\). However, the count of electrons at the junction capable of overcoming the barrier grows exponentially with \\(V_F\\). As electrons constitute minority carriers in the \\(p\\) region, the carrier concentration near the contact reduces due to a recombination process, resulting in forward current driven by diffusion.\nTherefore, the forward current \\(I\\) is anticipated to be an exponentially increasing function relative to the applied forward voltage \\(V_F\\). The overall relationship between \\(I\\) and \\(V\\) can be represented in its general expression.\n\\[  \nI = I_S(e^{qV_F/kT} - 1 )\n\\tag{5.11}\\]\nEquation 5.11 represents the ideal diode equation, which forecasts that the minor reverse-bias current will settle at \\(-I_S\\). This saturation persists even at low reverse bias voltages exceeding several \\(kT/q\\).

    "text": "5.9 pn Junction Current\nTo enhance our comprehension of the current flow through the pn junction, we can now incorporate some quantitative analysis. Staying true to the approach of this text, the quantitative explanation will be kept quite brief, primarily by presenting key principles as given assumptions or as a priori knowledge sourced from references.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.14: Forward-biased junction: (a) distribution of minority carriers on both sides of the transition region, alongside the definitions for distances \\(x_n\\) and \\(x_p\\) measured from the edges of the transition zone; (b) positional variation of the quasi-Fermi levels\n\n\n\nThe present derivation can be arranged by considering three separate electrostatic regions of a pn junction as illustrated in Figure 5.14. These regions include: the quasi-neutral p-region characterized by a zero electric field, the space charge region with a nonzero electric field, and the quasineutral n-region also with a zero electric field. Previous studies have elaborated extensively that the ideal forward bias current can be determined by examining the current within the quasi-neutral region, attributable to the low-level injection of minority carriers at the boundaries of the depletion region, \\(x_{p0}\\) and \\(x_{n0}\\). Under forward bias \\(V_F\\), the equilibrium ratio of hole concentrations (Equation 5.10) transforms into:\n\\[\n  p(x_{p0}) = p(x_{n0}) e^{q(V_0-V_F)/kT}\n\\tag{5.12}\\]\nIn low-level injection scenarios, the alteration in the majority carrier concentration is generally negligible (\\(p(x_{p0}) = p_p\\)). By substituting Equation 5.10 into Equation 5.12, the concentration of minority holes at \\(x_{n0}\\) can be represented as follows:\n\\[\n  p(x_{n0}) = p_n e^{qV_F/kT}\n\\tag{5.13}\\]\nTake into consideration that Equation 5.13 is originally formulated for a forward-biased junction, but it remains applicable for reverse bias by altering the sign of the voltage to negative. Under this condition, the carrier concentration falls below the equilibrium level. The concentration of excess minority carriers on both the p-side and n-side is given by:\n\\[\n\\Delta p_n = p(x_{n0}) - p_n = p_n \\left({e^{qV_F/kT} - 1}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n    \\Delta n_p = n(x_{p0}) - n_p = n_p\\left({e^{qV_F/kT} - 1}\\right)\n\\tag{5.14}\\]\nThe diffusion theory suggests that minority carriers are injected at the boundaries of the space charge region, resulting in a stable concentration of \\(\\Delta p_n\\) holes in the \\(n\\)-type material at \\(x_{n0}\\) and \\(\\Delta n_p\\) electrons in the \\(p\\)-type material at \\(x_{p0}\\). This injection initiates a distribution of minority carriers, which follows the diffusion equation.\n\\[\n\\delta p(x_p) = \\Delta p e^{-x_p/L_p}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\delta n(x_n) = \\Delta n e^{-x_n/L_n}\n\\tag{5.15}\\]\nwhere \\(L_p\\) and \\(L_n\\) represent the diffusion lengths for holes and electrons, respectively. It is also presumed that the dimensions of the \\(p\\) and \\(n\\) materials exceed their corresponding diffusion lengths. By incorporating Equation 5.14 into the diffusion equation, the distribution of minority carriers can be represented as follows:\n\\[\n\\delta p(x_p) = p_n\\left({e^{qV_F/kT} - 1}\\right) e^{-x_p/L_p}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\delta n(x_n) = n_p\\left({e^{qV_F/kT} - 1}\\right) e^{-x_n/L_n}\n\\tag{5.16}\\]\nIn the \\(n\\) material, the diffusion current of holes, and in the \\(p\\) material, the diffusion current of electrons can be determined by utilizing the diffusion component of the total current as described in Equation 5.8 :\n\\[\nJ_p(x_n) = -qD_p\\frac{d\\delta p(x_n)}{dx_n} = q \\frac{D_p}{L_p}\\delta p(x_n)\n\\]\n\\[\nJ_n(x_p) = qD_n\\frac{d\\delta n(x_p)}{dx_p} = q \\frac{D_n}{L_n}\\delta n(x_p)\n\\tag{5.17}\\]\nThe total current can be now calculated by adding the hole and electron current evaluated at \\(x_{n0}\\) and \\(x_{p0}\\) respectively:\n\\[\nI = qA\\left({\\frac{D_p}{L_p}p_n + \\frac{D_n}{L_n}n_p}\\right)\n    \\left({e^{V_F/kT} -1}\\right)\n\\]\nor,\n\\[\nI = I_S \\left({e^{V_F/kT} -1}\\right)\n\\tag{5.18}\\]\nwhere, \\(A\\) is the area of the \\(pn\\) junction. Equation 5.18 is the diode equation, that has the same form as the qualitative expression in Equation 5.11 .\nTo determine the reverse bias current, substitute the forward bias voltage \\(V_F\\) with the negative value of the reverse bias voltage \\(-V_R\\). When \\(V_R\\) exceeds a few times \\(kT/q\\), the complete current becomes equivalent to the reverse saturation current:\n\\[\nI = -qA\\left({\\frac{D_p}{L_p}p_n + \\frac{D_n}{L_n}n_p}\\right) = -I_S\n\\tag{5.19}\\]\n\n\n\n\nGray, Paul E., and Campbell L.

    "text": "6.1 Principle of Operation\nBipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) can be seen as a natural progression from the study of \\(pn\\) junctions. Though this text does not provide an exhaustive examination of BJTs, it will offer a basic introduction.\nA Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) operates as a controlling element by allowing minority carriers to move through the narrow base region between the emitter and collector junctions in the active region. This region is characterized by forward-biasing the emitter-base (E-B) junction and reverse-biasing the collector-base (C-B) junction, both bias voltages exceeding by few multiples of \\(\\kappa T/q\\). Under these conditions, the excess-carrier distribution in the base region is approximately linear as shown in Figure 6.4 . This region of operation is commonly used for linear signal amplification.\nUsing Figure 6.2 and Figure 6.3 as a visualizing tool, BJT valve action will be illustrated by tracking the hole diffusion current.\nWhen forward bias is applied to the E-B junction, the emitter introduces majority carriers as minority carriers into the base. In a pnp transistor, holes travel from the p-type emitter into the n-type base, whereas in an npn transistor, electrons move from the n-type emitter into the p-type base. The forward bias elevates the surplus carrier concentrations near the emitter’s space-charge region. Typically, the emitter is more heavily doped than the base, which ensures that the E-B junction current is largely due to carriers transitioning from the emitter into the base, thereby achieving high emitter injection efficiency.\nThe majority of injected minority carriers diffuse through the narrow base and arrive at the reverse-biased C-B junction. The base’s thinness and a high minority carrier lifetime are essential to reduce the recombination of these carriers with the base’s majority carriers (electrons in pnp, holes in npn). Upon entering the depletion region of the reverse-biased C-B junction, the robust electric field there propels the minority carriers into the collector. Since the C-B junction is reverse-biased, there is typically no significant carrier injection from the collector to the base. Thus, the collector current mainly consists of the minority carriers injected at the emitter that have successfully crossed the base. The collector section of the reverse-biased C-B junction acts as a sink, gathering the emitted carriers post-base traversal.",

The heavier doped emitter (\\(p+\\)) ensures that the junction current is dominated by carriers entering the base. The injected carriers diffuse through the narrow base to the reverse-biased C-B junction, where a strong electric field directs them into the collector. The thin base and long minority carrier lifetime reduce recombination. So, the collector current consists mainly of minority carriers of the emitter.",

    "text": "6.2 Terminal Currents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Excess carrier distribution in the base for active-region operation.\n\n\n\nThe terminal currents in the active region are linked to the excess minority carrier concentration within the base. Considering a pnp transistor, define \\(p_n(x)\\) as the hole concentration in the n-type base. The excess hole concentration is\n\\[\n\\Delta p_n(x) = p_n(x) - p_{n0}\n\\]\nwith \\(p_{n0}\\) as the equilibrium hole concentration. At the space-charge layer boundaries, the excess concentrations relate to junction voltages exponentially, as in pn junction:\n\\[\n\\Delta p_E \\approx p_n(0) = p_{n0} (e^{qV_{EB}/kT} - 1)\n\\]\nat the emitter junction (\\(x=0\\)), assuming \\(p_n(0) \\gg p_{n0}\\).\nSimilarly, the excess concentration at the collector junction is:\n\\[\n\\Delta p_C = p_n(W_b) = p_{n0} (e^{qV_{CB}/kT} - 1) \\approx -p_{n0}\n\\]\nat the reverse-biased collector junction (\\(x=W_b\\), with \\(W_b\\) being the base width). The excess concentration is negative due to the reverse-biased C-B junction.\nIn the context of a thin base with a linear excess minority carrier distribution (valid when \\(W_b\\) is significantly less than the diffusion length \\(L_p\\)), with bias assumption of few multiples of \\(\\kappa /Tq\\), \\(p_n(0) \\gg p_n(W_b)\\), consequently the concentration gradient is approximately \\(-p_n(0)/W_b\\). Therefore, the collector current \\(I_C\\) is linked to this gradient and can be expressed as:\n\\[\nI_C = -qA D_p \\frac{dp_n}{dx}|_{x=W_b}\n\\]\nor,\n\\[\nI_C \\approx qA D_p \\frac{p_n(0)}{W_b}\n\\]\nor,\n\\[\nI_C  = qA D_p \\frac{p_{n0}}{W_b} (e^{qV_{EB}/kT} - 1)\n\\]\nwith \\(q\\) representing the elementary charge, \\(A\\) the cross-sectional area, and \\(D_p\\) the minority-carrier (hole) diffusion coefficient in the base.\nIn qualitative terms, increasing the forward bias \\(V_{EB}\\) elevates \\(p_n(0)\\), resulting in a sharper concentration gradient and consequently a higher collector current. In contrast, the reverse bias \\(V_{CB}\\) exerts a smaller impact on \\(p_n(W_b)\\), approximating \\(-p_{n0}\\), provided that it exceeds a few multiples of \\(kT/q\\). The emitter current \\(I_E\\) is composed of the hole current entering the base (\\(I_{Ep}\\)) and the electron current moving from the base into the emitter (\\(I_{En}\\)):\n\\[\nI_E = I_{Ep} + I_{En}\n\\]\nThe hole current \\(I_{Ep}\\) is linked to the same concentration gradient responsible for \\(I_C\\), while \\(I_{En}\\) is influenced by the majority carriers’ injection from the base to the emitter and is reduced by increasing the emitter’s doping level.\nThe base current \\(I_B\\) provides electrons for recombination with injected holes in the base and facilitates the injection of majority carriers from the base to the emitter. It is given by\n\\[\nI_B = I_E - I_C = I_{En} + (1-B)I_{Ep}\n\\]\nwhere \\(B\\) is the base transport factor, indicating the portion of injected holes reaching the collector without recombining. A thin base with a long carrier lifetime results in \\(B\\) nearing one, reducing \\(I_B\\). All terminal currents (\\(I_C\\), \\(I_B\\), \\(I_E\\)) exhibit an exponential dependency on the emitter-base voltage \\(V_{EB}\\).",

    "text": "6.3 Power Amplification\nPower amplification (not voltage amplification) is the desired property of a transconductance device like the BJT. The transistor amplifies because a minor variation in the base current \\(I_B\\) (regulated by \\(V_{EB}\\)) leads to a significant change in the collector current \\(I_C\\). This is quantified by the common-emitter current gain, \\(\\beta\\) (also known as \\(h_{FE}\\)), which is the ratio of the collector current to the base current in the active region: \\(\\beta = \\frac{I_C}{I_B}\\). Given that \\(B \\approx 1\\) (indicating negligible recombination in the base) and emitter injection efficiency\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{I_{Ep}}{I_{Ep} + I_{En}} \\approx 1\n\\]\n(indicating little electron injection into the emitter), we have\n\\[\nI_C \\approx I_E\n\\]\nand a small \\(I_B\\).\nConsequently, the current transfer ratio\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{I_C}{I_E} = B\\gamma\n\\]\nis nearly one.

Thus, a small base current can control a substantially larger collector current, resulting in current amplification.\nThus, Power Amplification is achieved, as the minimal power used at the input (base-emitter junction) governs a larger power output in the collector circuit. The base-to-emitter voltage directly regulates the collector current, functioning like a control valve. The excess charge in the base area directly influences the collector current and can be adjusted through the base terminal.",

Figure 7.1(b) depicts the device voltages. The gate acts as the control electrode and the gate source voltage (\\(V_{GSn}\\)) regulates the drain current (\\(I_{Dn}\\)) from the drain to the source. The drain current depends on \\(V_{GSn}\\) and the drain-source voltage (\\(V_{DSn}\\)), while the source-bulk voltage (\\(V_{SBn}\\)) has a minor influence.\nFigure 7.2 (a) shows an nMOS with a metal gate (M) on silicon dioxide (O) over p-type silicon (S). This structure forms a capacitor between the gate and the semiconductor. The drain and source terminals are on the sides, with a bulk electrode attached to the substrate. The length of the channel (\\(L\\)) between the drain and the source is crucial. Figure 7.2 (b)’s top view shows that the channel width (\\(W\\)) allows current flow, with the aspect ratio (W/L) important for design. The drawn channel length (\\(L'\\)) exceeds the electrical length (\\(L\\)).\nThe MOSFET current-voltage characteristics (\\(I\\)-\\(V\\)) rely on a threshold voltage (\\(V_{Tn}\\)) determined by the manufacturing parameters. CMOS technology usually uses enhancement-mode MOSFETs with a positive threshold voltage.\nThe MOS structure enables drain-to-source conduction due to its capacitor-like traits. A positive gate voltage induces negative charge in the semiconductor under the oxide via the field effect, altering surface charge distribution.\nIn an ideal n-channel MOSFET, when \\(V_{GSn} &lt; V_{Tn}\\), it is in cutoff with zero current flow (\\(I_d\\)). Only immobile bulk charge exists under the gate, and the drain and source are separated by reverse-biased pn junctions.\nWhen \\(V_{GSn} \\geq V_{Tn}\\), an electron inversion layer is formed under the oxide, creating a conduction path from the drain to the source. Applying \\(V_{DSn}\\) generates an electric field in the channel, driving electrons from source to drain, resulting in a drain current (\\(I_{Dn}\\)).",
