# Linear Circuits {#chap-linear-ckts}

This chapter assumes the reader knows basic linear circuit analysis and needs a refresher. We focus on key techniques like linearity properties, Thevenin-Norton equivalents, and interface circuit design.


# Basic Circuit Analysis {#sec-linear-ckts-basics}

 We have derived the $I-V$ characteristics of resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Although these devices are often non-linear in practice, we will use their linear models, known as circuit elements, and apply the following linear equations:

 $$Resistor: v = iR$$

 also known as Ohm's law,
 
 $$Capacitor: i = C\frac{dv}{dt}$$

 $$Inductor: v = L \frac{di}{dt}$$

 The capacitor and inductor are non-dissipative devices but resistor is not, and the power dissipated by it is given by

 $$ p = v^2/R$$


 or,

 $$ p = i^2 R$$
