# Linear Circuits {#chap-linear-ckts}

This chapter assumes the reader knows basic linear circuit analysis and needs a refresher. We focus on key techniques like linearity properties, Thevenin-Norton equivalents, and interface circuit design.


## Basic Circuit Analysis {#sec-linear-ckts-basics}

 **PASSIVE DEVICE** (R,L,C)  $I-V$ characteristics has been derived. Although these devices are often non-linear in practice, we will use their linear models, known as _circuit elements_, and apply the following linear equations:

 $$Resistor: v = iR$$

 also known as Ohm's law,
 
 $$Capacitor: i = C\frac{dv}{dt}$$

 $$Inductor: v = L \frac{di}{dt}$$

 The capacitor and inductor are non-dissipative devices but resistor is not, and the power dissipated by it is given by

 $$ p = v^2/R$$


 or,

 $$ p = i^2 R$$

Determine the current flowing through a $3.3 k\Omega$ resistor when $3.3 V$ is applied across it, and calculate the power it dissipates.

A resistor remains linear when voltage and current are within its power rating limits. For a $10~k\Omega$ resistor with a power rating of $0.25 W$, determine the maximum current and voltage to keep it within its linear range

**IDEAL SOURCES** are essential for electronic circuits to function and are represented by two elements: voltage sources and current sources.

The $i–v$ characteristic of an **ideal voltage source** is described by the following element equations:

$$ v=v_s \text{ and } i=\text{any value}$$

where, $v_s$ is voltage across the source and $i$ is the current flowing through it.

The $i–v$ characteristic of an **ideal current source** is described by the following element equations:

$$ i=i_s \text{ and } v=\text{any value}$$

where, $s_s$ is the current flowing through the source and $v$ is the voltage across it.

In circuit analysis, the voltage or current from ideal sources is called a **forcing** or **driving** function, as it triggers a circuit response. Time-varying voltage or current is typically denoted as $v(t)$ or $i(t)$.


**CONNECTION CONSTRAINTS** are activated when devices are connected within a circuit. Two essential principles governed by connection constraints are Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL).

Kirchhoff‘s Current Law

Kirchhoff's first law is founded on the conservation of charge principle. Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) asserts that


the algebraic sum of the currents entering a node is zero at every instant.


When summing currents algebraically, consider each device's reference direction: assign a positive sign if directed into the node, and a negative sign if directed away.

::: {.callout-tip title="Example"}

Applying this convention to the nodes in Figure-FIXME, we obtain the following set of KCL connection equations:

$$
\text{Node A:} -i_1 - i_2 = 0
\text{Node B:} i_1 - i_3 - i_4 + i_5= 0
\text{Node A:} i_2 + i_3 + i_4 - i_5= 0
$$

:::

The KCL equation at node A indicates that the reference direction for currents $i_1$ and $i_2$ is away from node A, not that they are negative. Similarly, the equation at node B could be expressed as

$$
i_1  + i_5 =  i_3 + i_4
$$



This example demonstrates a different formulation of KCL:

> **The sum of the currents entering a node equals the sum of the currents leaving the node**.

Another general principle that can be easily derived from KCL:

> **In a circuit containing a total of N nodes there are only N – 1 independent KCL connection equations**.

The current equations specified at N – 1 nodes encapsulate all the independent connection constraints derivable from the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL).
