# Linear Circuits {#chap-linear-ckts}

This chapter assumes the reader knows basic linear circuit analysis and needs a refresher. We focus on key techniques like linearity properties, Thevenin-Norton equivalents, and interface circuit design.


## Basic Circuit Analysis {#sec-linear-ckts-basics}

 **PASSIVE DEVICE** (R,L,C)  $I-V$ characteristics has been derived. Although these devices are often non-linear in practice, we will use their linear models, known as _circuit elements_, and apply the following linear equations:

 $$Resistor: v = iR$$

 also known as Ohm's law,
 
 $$Capacitor: i = C\frac{dv}{dt}$$

 $$Inductor: v = L \frac{di}{dt}$$

 The capacitor and inductor are non-dissipative devices but resistor is not, and the power dissipated by it is given by

 $$ p = v^2/R$$


 or,

 $$ p = i^2 R$$

Determine the current flowing through a $3.3 k\Omega$ resistor when $3.3 V$ is applied across it, and calculate the power it dissipates.

::: {.callout-tip title="Excercise: Linear range calculation"}
A resistor remains linear when voltage and current are within its power rating limits. For a $10 k\Omega$ resistor with a power rating of $0.25 W$, determine the maximum current and voltage to keep it within its linear range

**IDEAL SOURCES** are essential for electronic circuits to function and are represented by two elements: voltage sources and current sources.

The $i–v$ characteristic of an **ideal voltage source** is described by the following element equations:

$$ v=v_s \text{ and } i=\text{any value}$$

where, $v_s$ is voltage across the source and $i$ is the current flowing through it.

The $i–v$ characteristic of an **ideal current source** is described by the following element equations:

$$ i=i_s \text{ and } v=\text{any value}$$

where, $s_s$ is the current flowing through the source and $v$ is the voltage across it.

In circuit analysis, the voltage or current from ideal sources is called a forcing or driving function, as it triggers a circuit response. Time-varying voltage or current is typically denoted as $v(t)$ or $i(t)$.
