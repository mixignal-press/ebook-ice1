	abstract = {The fourth edition of CMOS Digital Integrated Circuits: Analysis and Design continues the well-established tradition of the earlier editions by offering the most comprehensive coverage of digital CMOS circuit design, as well as addressing state-of-the-art technology issues highlighted by the widespread use of nanometer-scale CMOS technologies. In this latest edition, virtually all chapters have been re-written, the transistor model equations and device parameters have been revised to reflect the sigificant changes that must be taken into account for new technology generations, and the material has been reinforced with up-to-date examples.  The broad-ranging coverage of this textbook starts with the fundamentals of CMOS process technology, and continues with MOS transistor models, basic CMOS gates, interconnect effects, dynamic circuits, memory circuits, arithmetic building blocks, clock and I/O circuits, low power design techniques, design for manufacturability and design for testability.},

	abstract = {The Analysis and Design of Linear Circuits, 8th Edition provides an introduction to the analysis, design, and evaluation of electric circuits, focusing on developing the learners design intuition. The text emphasizes the use of computers to assist in design and evaluation. Early introduction to circuit design motivates the student to create circuit solutions and optimize designs based on real-world constraints. This text is an unbound, three hole punched version.},
