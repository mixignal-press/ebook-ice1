	abstract = {The fourth edition of CMOS Digital Integrated Circuits: Analysis and Design continues the well-established tradition of the earlier editions by offering the most comprehensive coverage of digital CMOS circuit design, as well as addressing state-of-the-art technology issues highlighted by the widespread use of nanometer-scale CMOS technologies. In this latest edition, virtually all chapters have been re-written, the transistor model equations and device parameters have been revised to reflect the sigificant changes that must be taken into account for new technology generations, and the material has been reinforced with up-to-date examples.  The broad-ranging coverage of this textbook starts with the fundamentals of CMOS process technology, and continues with MOS transistor models, basic CMOS gates, interconnect effects, dynamic circuits, memory circuits, arithmetic building blocks, clock and I/O circuits, low power design techniques, design for manufacturability and design for testability.},

	isbn = {978-1-118-21128-1},
	shorttitle = {Inductance},
	abstract = {The only resource devoted Solely to Inductance Inductance is an unprecedented text, thoroughly discussing "loop" inductance as well as the increasingly important "partial" inductance. These concepts and their proper calculation are crucial in designing modern high-speed digital systems. World-renowned leader in electromagnetics Clayton Paul provides the knowledge and tools necessary to understand and calculate inductance. Unlike other texts, Inductance provides all the details about the derivations of the inductances of various inductors, as well as:   Fills the need for practical knowledge of partial inductance, which is essential to the prediction of power rail collapse and ground bounce problems in high-speed digital systems   Provides a needed refresher on the topics of magnetic fields   Addresses a missing link: the calculation of the values of the various physical constructions of inductors—both intentional inductors and unintentional inductors—from basic electromagnetic principles and laws   Features the detailed derivation of the loop and partial inductances of numerous configurations of current-carrying conductors   With the present and increasing emphasis on high-speed digital systems and high-frequency analog systems, it is imperative that system designers develop an intimate understanding of the concepts and methods in this book. Inductance is a much-needed textbook designed for senior and graduate-level engineering students, as well as a hands-on guide for working engineers and professionals engaged in the design of high-speed digital and high-frequency analog systems.},
