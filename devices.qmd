# Semiconductor IC devices {#chap-semi-dev}

## Introduction {#sec-semi-dev-intro}

The large-scale integration of electronic circuits is rooted in the invention and evolution of semiconductor devices. We will discuss electronic materials to explain the fundamental properties of semiconductors in IC design and their role in the success of integrated circuits.

| Al | 2.65 | 26.5 |
| Cu | 1.68 | 16.8 |
| Au | 2.44 | 24.4 |

The fundamental materials in integrated circuits include metals, dielectrics, and semiconductors. Metals are used as conductors for interconnects because of their extremely low specific resistivity. 
_Specific resistivity_ ($\rho$) is a property of the material that can be defined as _resistance per unit volume_ expressed in SI units of $\Omega m$ but more conveniently as $\Omega cm$. The resistance of a rectangular piece of that material can be expressed as $R=\rho\cdot l/A$, where $l$ is the length and $A$ is the cross-sectional area.
In integrated circuit design, the height of the metal routing is fixed and is typically in the range of $0.1$ to $5$ micrometers ($\mu m, 10^{-6} m)$ and the resistance is measured in unit squares as \textit{ ohms per square} or $\Omega/\square$.
The specific resistance (in $\Omega cm$) and unit resistance (in $\Omega/\square$) of typical metals used in integrated circuits such as aluminum (Al), copper (Cu) and gold (Au) are tabulated in @tbl-devices-rho. 
Dielectric materials have extremely large specific resistances that provide electrical insulation for typical operating conditions. Specific resistances for semiconductors can vary enormously $-$ from $10^{-4} ~\Omega cm$ to $10^{12} ~\Omega cm$.



The history of semiconductors began with Tomas Seebeck's observation of lead sulfur (PbS) properties in 1821. Michael Faraday noted that semiconductor resistance decreases with rising temperatures, unlike conductors. Early applications include Werner von Siemens' selenium photometer (1875) and Alexander Graham Bell's wireless device (1878). The pivotal discovery of the Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) by Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain in 1947 led to today's integrated circuits with millions of devices in a single IC.

Electronic systems operate using a power supply formed by non-electric forces that separate charges to create a **potential difference**. Chemical forces generate batteries, while turbines produce AC, which is converted to DC voltages. This potential difference forms an electric field, driving current in the circuit. Manipulating this current with semiconductor devices in an integrated circuit is essential for intelligent systems like modern computers..

Semiconductor devices excel in integrated circuits due to their rapid conductivity changes, small size, and low energy use. They are manufactured at nanometer scales with switching speeds of 100 gigahertz, consuming nanowatts of power. Their conductivity can shift dramatically from insulator to conductor, representing digital _zeros_ and _ones_. Understanding semiconductors like silicon involves studying the physics of their conductivity changes, which vary significantly with temperature as well.

Some excellent references for this subject matter are [@shur_introduction_1996], [@pierret_semiconductor_1996], and [@streetman_solid_2014]. 


## Energy Band Model {#sec-semi-dev-band}

The energy band model explains the conduction properties of matter easily that we will introduce now using _quantum mechanical properties of matter_. Instead of explaining the model for a semiconductor crystal such as silicon, the basic principles can be explained using a much simpler atomic system, the _isolated hydrogen atom_. During the 1900s, the emission spectrum of heated gases did not agree with the contemporary physical model of continuous electron energy. In order to reconcile the discrepancy, in 1913 Neils Bohr proposed that the electrons can have only certain discrete allowed energy levels, called **energy states**. 

For hydrogen atom the quantization of energy states is $E_n = -E_B/n^2$ where $n = 1,2,3,4,\ldots$ is called the _energy quantum number_ and $E_B$ is called the _Bohr energy_ or the _electron binding energy_.

For hydrogen atom, Bohr energy $E_B = 13.6 eV/n^2$

Electron energies are expressed in _electron volt_ (eV), the work done to move an electron across a potential difference of $1~V$. 

[$1~eV = q\times 1V = 1.602\times 10^{-19} Joule$]

Let us now study the many electron energies of a Si crystal (Si), which is more complicated, but the basic principles still apply. The concept of _band diagrams_ can be qualitatively conceived by starting with N-isolated Si atoms and observing the energy states as the atoms are brought closer and closer together (see @fig-semi-dev-band). _Pauli exclusion principle_ plays an important role in determining energy states as the atoms are brought closer. The principle states that no more than two electrons can occupy each energy state. In a solid material, as many atoms (N) are brought closer, the energy states start to split to satisfy the exclusion principle. At the interatomic spacing of the lattice, the split energy levels form essentially continuous _energy bands_. However, these bands are separated by _forbidden energy gaps_ that cannot be occupied by any electron. The magnitude of the forbidden energy gaps determines primarily the electrical properties of different materials. In filling the allowed energy states, electrons tend to gravitate to the lowest possible states. At room temperature in semiconductors and dielectrics, almost all of the states in the lower energy bands are filled by electrons, and the higher energy states are mostly empty. The upper band of the allowed states is called the _conduction band_; the lower band of the allowed states is called the _valence band_; and the gap between the two bands without any allowed energy states, the _forbidden band_ or the _energy band gap_. An electron in the valence band needs energy equal to or greater than the energy band gap to transition from the valence band to the conduction band. 

![Illustration of the distinction between (a) insulator, (b) semiconductor, and (c) metal.](figures/fig-semi-dev-class.png){#fig-semi-dev-class}

Typically, for semiconductors, the energy band gap, $E_g$, varies between $0.1~eV$ and $3.5~eV$.

At room temperature (T=300K), $E_G=1.42eV$  (GaAs), $E_G=1.12eV$ (Si), and $E_G=0.66eV$ (Ge).

In dielectric, the energy band gap is large and so the valence bands are completely filled and the conduction band is totally void of electrons making them perfect insulators. Typically for dielectrics, $E_g$ is larger than $5~eV$ (diamond) to $8~eV~(SiO_2)$. In a metal, the lowest conduction band is partially filled with many electrons, making it an ideal conductor.

## Carriers

Carriers are the current-carrying entities within the semiconductor material and we are now in a position to introduce them, the semiconductor model having been well established. Referring to our bonding model, there are no carriers or possible current flow if no bonds are broken in the semiconductor solid. In the energy band model, this refers to a valence band which is _completely_ filled with electrons and a conduction band which is completely devoid of electrons. This will be the case for a _pure_ semiconductor like a silicon crystal at temperature $T=0^\circ K$. Now, for an electron to carry current under the influence of an applied electric field, it has to break free from the bond, for example, the Si-Si bond. In terms of the energy band model, this refers to an electron from the valence band jumping over to the conduction band creating _carriers_; that is, _electrons in the conduction band are carriers_. Note that the energy required to break a bond is the same as the forbidden energy gap $E_G$.

![Visualization of carriers using the bonding model (left) and the energy band model (right) (a) No-carrier situation; (b) visualization of an electron; (c ) visualization of a hole](figures/fig-semi-dev-carrierviz.png){#fig-semi-dev-carrierviz}

The _average thermal energy of an electron_, in equilibrium, is equal to $3k_BT/2$ where, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature in degrees Kelvin. The generally accepted room temperature is $27^\circ C$ or $300~K$.

$k_BT = 1.38\times 10^{-23} \frac{J}{K} \times 300~K = 0.026~eV$

This energy is attributed to the electron's thermal motion inside the crystal lattice that can be explained accurately using quantum mechanics. But an _effective mass_ formulation is a simplified _classical_ way of explaining the same phenomenon. This allows us to formulate the carriers as _quasi-classical particles_ and employ classical particle relationships in most device analyzes. Using this formulation, the average thermal energy can be attributed to the average kinetic energy $m^*_n v_{th}^2/2$ where $m^*_n$ is the _effective electron mass_ and $v_{th}$ is called the electron _thermal velocity_. 

The electron effective mass $m^*_n$ is different from the free electron mass $m^*_e$ which is $9.11\times 10^{-31}kg$. For example, in silicon, $m^*_n\approx 0.066~m_e$.

However, $3k_BT/2$ is just the average energy, and the actual energies of an individual electron vary widely. A few electrons acquire enough thermal energy to jump into the conduction band.

Energy gap $E_G$ of silicon (Si) is $\approx 1.12 ~eV$ which is approximately 45 times larger than $k_BT$ at room temperature!

Since there can be no current in the absence of an electric field, the random motions of the electrons compensate for each other. In the presence of an electric field, in addition to random motions, the electrons seem to drift in the direction of the electric with a so-called _drift velocity_ which results in an electric current.

Now let us look at a phenomenon, unique to semiconductors, when an electron breaks _free_ from a bond. It leaves a _vacancy_ for another electron to break free from its bond and occupy this vacancy which in turn leaves another vacancy and so on leading to an _appearance_ of a motion of a vacant electron of a _positive_ charge $q=-(-q)$ and an effective mass of $m^*_p$. This motion is typically represented as a fictitious particle called a _hole_. This phenomenon can be imagined as analogous to the _bubble in a fluid_. In terms of the energy band model, jumping an electron to the conduction band creates a _hole_ in an otherwise vast sea of filled states. This empty state, like a bubble in a fluid, moves about rather freely in the solid because of the cooperative motion of valence-band electrons that give room to this hole in motion. Like a free electron carrier, when an electric field is applied to this semiconductor, the hole, an apparent _positive electron_, will move in the direction of the electric field, giving rise to electric current.

![Electrons move in an electric field. The band diagrams are like @fig-semi-dev-class, but with an expanded energy scale showing closely packed levels, each accommodating two electrons.

## Band Diagrams

Band diagrams are a very efficient way of illustrating electrical properties of semiconductor materials and devices without going into the detail atomic or molecular structure of the material. As shown in @fig-semi-dev-carrier-efield, the band diagram represents the electrical energies allowed within the semiconductor as a function of position, where the increase in energy $E$ upward represents the total energy of electrons. The _charge carriers_ or _free charge carriers_ start to occupy the lowest energy states in the conduction band which are _lower edge of the conduction band_ ($E_C$) and _upper edge of the valence band_ ($E_V$) for _electrons_ and _holes_, respectively.

Therefore, to analyze or understand the electrical behavior of a _uniform_ semiconductor material it is typically sufficient to study the material properties with the _band edges_ only. Normal operation is assumed here without any external disturbances, where the electric field, magnetic field, temperature gradient, and stress-induced effects are negligible.

 On careful examination of the band diagram, we can show that an energy equal to the _bandgap_, $E_G = E_C-E_V$, is required to break an atomic bond to create _motionless_ electrons and holes occupying $E_C$ and $E_V$, respectively. Therefore, we can interpret the edges of the band $E_C$ and $E_V$ as the potential energy of the electron and hole, respectively, with reference to an arbitrary energy level $E_{ref}$.
 
 Potential Energy: $P.E.=E_C-E_{ref}$ NOTE: Show PE and KE on the diagram itself.
 
 Any energy in excess of $E_G$ will result in the kinetic energy shown in figure @fig-semi-dev-band-electrostatic, with the carriers moving rapidly in the lattice. The potential energy is the key to relating the positional variations in the energy band with the electric field within the semiconductor. The potential energy ($P.E.$) of an electron ($-q$) can be expressed as $-qV$, where $V$ is the electrostatic potential at a given point with reference to an arbitrary constant. The potential can be expressed in terms of $E_C$ using the relationship shown previously between $P.E.$ and $E_C$.

 $$
 P.E. = -qV = E_C - E_{ref}
 $$
 
 $$
 V=-1/q(E_C - E_{ref})
 $$

![Energy band diagrams for an uniform semiconductor sample in (a) zero and (b) non-zero electric field.](figures/fig-semi-dev-band-efield){#fig-semi-dev-band-efield}
 
The band diagram of a piece of semiconductor with the presence of an electric field $E$ is shown as an example in @fig-semi-dev-band-efield (b). The bands are _tilted_ with a slope of $-qE$ popularly known as _band bending_. Since electrons are negatively charged, the direction of the forces on electrons is opposite to that of the electric field. The forces on the holes are in the same direction as the electric field. Consequently, the electrons and holes move in opposite directions.

$$
E=-\nabla V \text{ or,} 
$$

$$
E_x = -dV/dx
$$

$$
E_x = \frac{1}{q}\frac{dE_C}{dx} \text{ or,}
$$

$$
E_x = \frac{1}{q}\frac{dE_V}{dx}  \text{ or,}
$$

$$
E_x = \frac{1}{q}\frac{dE_i}{dx}
$$

Using basic electrostatic laws, the relationship between the potential $V$ and electric field $\vec{E}$ can be established. For quick analysis by inspection, the $V$ and $x$ relationship can be found simply by "inverting" $E_C$ (or $E_V$) and to determine the $\vec{E}$ versus $x$ relationship, simply note the slope of $E_C$ (or $E_V$).

A pure semiconductor that contains an insignificant amount of impurity atoms is commonly referred to as _an intra-intrinsic semiconductor_. In other words, it is a semiconductor whose properties are native to the material without any external additives. In an intrinsic semiconductor, the electron concentration in the conduction band and the holes in the valence band are negligible compared to the number of available energy states within $k_B T$ from the edges of the band.

:Intrinsic electron-hole concentration of different semiconductor material at room temperature {#tbl-semi-dev-ni-conc}

In general, the number of electrons and holes per cubic-centimeter are defined as $n$ and $p$ respectively. Since electrons and holes are created in pairs in an intrinsic semiconductor, the concentrations of electrons and holes are the same and are represented as $n_i$ where $n_i=n=p$. The intrinsic electron-hole concentrations in some popular semiconductor material are tabulated in @tbl-semi-dev-ni-conc. Although the absolute concentration appears to be a large number, it is an insignificant number compared to the density of atoms in the material. For example, in silicon (Si) there are $5\times 10^{22}~atoms/cm^3$. An intrinsic concentration of $n_i\approx 10^{10}/cm^3$ is less than _one broken bond_ in $10^{13}$ atoms.

## Doping 

Doping is a semiconductor engineering method to change the electron or hole concentration of the native material by many orders of magnitude. As a result, the conductance of the semiconductor varies by a large magnitude. Doping is a routine method in IC fabrication in which semiconductor impurity atoms called _dopants_ are added to the pure semiconductor material. Dopants that increase the electron concentration of the native semiconductor material are called _donors_. Consequently, _acceptors_ are dopants that increase hole concentration.

![Visualization of (a) donor and (b) acceptor actions via the bonding model. In (a), _Column V_ element P replaces a Si atom; in (b), Column III element B replaces a Si atom.](figures/fig-semi-dev-viz-doping){#fig-semi-dev-viz-doping}


Commonly used silicon dopants are listed in @tbl-semi-dev-si-dopants. Phosphorous dopants, closely followed by arsenic, are the most commonly used donor dopants to increase the electron concentration. Boron is the most commonly used acceptor dopant for increasing hole concentration. 

The donors are all from the Column-V of the Periodic Table of Elements and correspondingly, the acceptors are from Column-III. 

As shown in @fig-semi-dev-viz-doping, using the bonding model, when a Column-V element replaces a silicon atom, four valence electrons bond with nearby silicon atoms, while the fifth is _weakly_ bound to the donor site. At room temperature, this electron gains enough energy to become a conduction band carrier without increasing hole concentration, leaving an immobile ion. 

The binding energy of a Phosphorous donor electron in silicon is about $0.045~eV$ compared to $1~eV$ for Si-Si atom.

A semiconductor doped with donors is called an _n-type_ semiconductor.

$n+$ and $n-$ refers to _heavily_ and _lightly_ doped n-type semiconductor. 

At room temperature or above, each donor atom in an n-type semiconductor contributes one electron to the conduction band, making the electron concentration in the conduction band approximately equal to the donor concentration, typically expressed in $atoms/cm^3$.

A Column-III acceptor element replaces a silicon atom, accepting an electron from a neighboring Si-Si bond to complete its bonding. This creates a hole that can move through the lattice, depicted as a hole weakly bound to the acceptor site.

The binding energy of a Boron  acceptor hole in silicon is about $0.045~eV$.

 A semiconductor doped with an acceptor is called an _p-type_ semiconductor. At room temperature or hotter temperatures, each acceptor atom in an p-type semiconductor supplies one hole to the valence band and therefore the hole concentration, $p$, in the valence band is approximately equal to the acceptor concentration, $N_A$, typically expressed in $atoms/cm^3$.
 
$p+$ and $p-$ refer to _heavily_ and _lightly_ doped n-type semiconductor, respectively.

 
 An important relation used in the analysis of semiconductor devices is the _constant_ product of hole and electron concentration, $p$ and $n$, for a given temperature, which can be conveniently written as 

$$
    np = n_i^2
$$

where, $n_i$ is the electron or hole concentration in an intrinsic semiconductor material at that temperature.
