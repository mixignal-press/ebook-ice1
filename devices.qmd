# Semiconductor IC devices {#chap-semi-dev}

## Introductiona {#sec-semi-dev-intro}

The large-scale integration of electronic circuits is rooted in the invention and evolution of semiconductor devices. We will discuss electronic materials to explain the fundamental properties of semiconductors in IC design and their role in the success of integrated circuits.

| Cu | 1.68 | 16.8 |

:Specific resistance (at $20^\circ C$) of typical metals used in integrated circuits expressed in $\Omega cm$ and, the unit resistance of a height of $1\mu m$ metal expressed in $\Omega/\square$ {#tbl-devices-rho}

The fundamental materials in integrated circuits include metals, dielectrics, and semiconductors. Metals are used as conductors for interconnects because of their extremely low specific resistivity. 
\textit{Specific resistivity} ($\rho$) is a property of the material that can be defined as _resistance per unit volume_ expressed in SI units of $\Omega m$ but more conveniently as $\Omega cm$. The resistance of a rectangular piece of that material can be expressed as $R=\rho\cdot l/A$, where $l$ is the length and $A$ is the cross-sectional area.
In integrated circuit design, the height of the metal routing is fixed and is typically in the range of $0.1$ to $5$ micrometers ($\mu m, 10^{-6} m)$ and the resistance is measured in unit squares as \textit{ ohms per square} or $\Omega/\square$.
The specific resistance (in $\Omega cm$) and unit resistance (in $\Omega/\square$) of typical metals used in integrated circuits such as aluminum (Al), copper (Cu) and gold (Au) are tabulated in @tbl-devices-rho. 
Dielectric materials have extremely large specific resistances that provide electrical insulation for typical operating conditions. Specific resistances for semiconductors can vary enormously $-$ from $10^{-4} ~\Omega cm$ to $10^{12} ~\Omega cm$.
