## Resistance {#sec-passive-res}

![Setup for resistance calculation](figures/fig-passives-res.png){#fig-passive-res}

Resistance calculation of metal or semiconductor material is fundamental to IC engineering.
Consider a block of metal or semiconductor material with dimensions $L, W$ and $h$ as shown in @fig-passive-res. Let $n$ be the charge per unit volume.
To calculate the current $I_R$ for an applied voltage $V_R$ across the length of the material, we will consider an incremental cross section of the material with length $\Delta x$. 
The current can be written as the total charge in the incremental volume in time $\Delta t$: 

$I_R = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{Q_S \Delta x}{\Delta t} = Q_S v_d$

$I_R = Sheet Charge \times Average Velocity$ or, 

where, $Q_S = nWh$ is the sheet-charge or the charge per unit length,

$v_d$ is the average velocity of the electrons:

$v_d= \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \mu E$, and 

where, $E = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta x}$, and $\mu$ is the _mobility_ of the material.

Therefore, $I_R = \mu Q_S \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta x}$

The incremental resistance can be expressed as 

$\Delta R = \Delta v / I_R = \rho \frac{\Delta x}{W h}$

where, $\rho = 1/(n \mu)$ is the _Specific resistivity_ ($\rho$) is a property of the material that can be defined as the resistance per unit volume expressed in SI units of $\Omega m$ but more conveniently as $\Omega cm$. 

The total resistance of the volume can be found by summing up all incremental resistances $\Delta R$:

$R = \rho \frac{L}{A}$

where, $L$ is the length and $A$ is the cross-sectional areai ($W h$).

In integrated circuit design, the height of the metal routing is fixed and is typically in the range of $0.1$ to $5$ micrometers ($\mu m, 10^{-6} m)$ and the resistance is measured in square units as _ohms per square_ or $\Omega/\square$.

$R = (\rho/h) (L/W)$

Where, $\rho/h$ is typically called sheet-rho ($\rho_{sheet}$)

The specific resistance (in $\Omega cm$) and unit resistance (in $\Omega/\square$) of typical metals used in integrated circuits such as aluminum (Al), copper (Cu) and gold (Au) are tabulated:

| | $\mu -\Omega$ cm | $m\Omega/\square$ |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Al | 2.65 | 26.5 |
| Cu | 1.68 | 16.8 |
| Au | 2.44 | 24.4 |

and the measured resistance across the length is $35 \Omega$.

## Capacitance {#sec-passive-cap}

![Parallel plate capacitance calculation](figures/fig-passive-cap.png){#fig-passive-cap}


Consider two parallel metal plates of area $A$ separated by distance $d$ as shown in @fig-passive-cap .

If the total charge on the top and bottom plate is $+Q$ and $-Q$ respectively, and the potential on the plates are $V_1$ and $V_2$ respectively, total charge on the plate is directly proportional to the potential difference ($V=V_1-V_2$):

$Q \propto V$

And the proportionality constant is the _capacitance_ $C$ of the parallel plates:

$Q = CV$

In order to calculate the capacitance of the parallel plates, we will apply Gauss' law ($\nabla\cdot \vec{E} = \rho /\epsilon_0$) by enclosing the top plate (or bottom plate), as show in @fig-passive-cap and calculate the total electric field _diverging_ from the enclosed volume. 

Assuming a large area and a small separation, the peripheral electric field can be neglected and average electric field $\vec{E}$ can be expressed as:

$\vec{E} = \frac{V}{d}$

Applying Gauss's to find the divergence of $\vec{E}$:

$\int \vec{E}\cdot da = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}$

The flux leaving the bottom surface integrated results in:

$EA = \frac{V}{d}A = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}$

Therefore, the capacitance of the parallel plates can be expressed as:

$C = A\epsilon_0/d$

In the presence of _dielectric_ material, the capacitance is expressed as:

$C = A (1+\chi)\epsilon_0 / d = A\kappa \epsilon_0 / d$

where, $\chi$ is the dielectric _susceptibility_ and $\kappa$ is the _relative permittivity_.
