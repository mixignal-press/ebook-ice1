**ASSIGNMENT**

- Find the _Thevenin equivalent_ circuit for the microphone for normal voice operation. 
  - A quick review of the topic can be found [here](https://mixignal-press.github.io/ebook-ice1/circuits.html#thevenin-and-norton-equivalent-circuits)
- Substitute the microphone's Thevenin's equivalent and find the _frequency response_ of the analog front-end (AFE).
