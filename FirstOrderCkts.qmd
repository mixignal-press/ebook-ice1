The **node analysis** for the parallel RC circuit yields:

$$
i(t) = \frac{v_C}{R} + C \frac{dv_C}{dt}
$$

Or, rewritten as:

$$
\frac{dv_C}{dt} + \frac{v_C}{RC} = \frac{i(t)}{C}
$$

This is a linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

The **complete solution** consists of two parts:

1. **Homogeneous Solution**
2. **Particular Solution**

The overall solution is the sum of these two parts.


The **homogeneous equation**:

$$
\frac{dv_{CH}}{dt} + \frac{v_{CH}}{RC} = 0
$$

Assume $v_{CH} = Ae^{st}$:

Substituting and solving gives:

$$
s = -\frac{1}{RC}
$$

So,

$$
v_{CH} = A e^{-t/RC}
$$

- Product $RC$ has dimension of time called _time-constant_ .

---

**Particular Solution**

For a constant input current $I_0$:

$$
I_0 = \frac{v_{cp}}{R} + C \frac{dv_{cp}}{dt}
$$

Assume $v_{CP} = K$:

Substitute into the equation:

$$
v_{CP} = I_0 R
$$

---

**Complete Solution**

Combine both solutions:

$$
v_C = A e^{-t/RC} + I_0 R
$$

Apply initial condition at $t = 0$:

$$
A = -I_0 R
$$

Thus,

$$
v_C = -I_0 R e^{-t/RC} + I_0 R
$$

or

$$
v_C = I_0 R (1 - e^{-t/RC})
$$

**Effect of RC Value**

- **Small RC:** Faster charging, steeper curve.
- **Large RC:** Slower charging, gradual curve.

---

**Discharge Transient**

For the discharge case (homogeneous solution):

- Initial condition: $v_C = I_0 R$ at $t = 0$
- Solution:

$$
v_C = I_0 R e^{-t/RC}
$$

---

**General Form**

$$
v_C = v_C(0) e^{-t/RC}
$$

---

**Properties of the Exponential Decay**

- For $x = A e^{-t/\tau}$, the initial slope at $t = 0$:

$$
\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{t=0} = -\frac{A}{\tau}
$$

- At $t = \tau$:

$$
x(\tau) = \frac{A}{e}
$$

- Time to go from 90\% to 10\%:

$$
t_{90\%} - t_{10\%} = RC \ln\left(\frac{0.9}{0.1}\right) = 2.2\tau
$$

**Summary Table**

| Parameter | Formula | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Time Constant ($\tau$) | $RC$ | Determines response speed |
| Charging Voltage | $I_0 R (1 - e^{-t/RC})$ | Step input |
| Discharge Voltage | $v_C(0) e^{-t/RC}$ | Initial voltage $v_C(0)$ |
| Initial Slope | $-A/\tau$ | At $t = 0$ |
| 90%-10% Time Span | $2.2\tau$ | Exponential decay |

**Notes**

- The exponential response is a hallmark of first-order RC circuits.
- The time constant $RC$ is critical for determining how quickly the voltage changes in response to a step input or discharge.
